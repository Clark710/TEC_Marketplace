# Group-Project
Main Project (75%)
For this project you will develop an online shopping and market place system.
There will be three separate assessments as a part of this project. Two these
are individual, and the third is done in your teams. While you will do the
implementation in groups of 4-5, you must prepare the individual assessments
individually.  Groups will be allocated for you, and groups will be provided a
PostgreSQL database for a store. Not all of the data in the database has to be
used, and you are allowed to modify the database as you see fit.  You can
provide a list of up to 3 people you refuse to work with, which we will try as
much as possible to use.  Group information will be posted here. Comments on
groups are open until the lecture on Thursday (7th April), and groups will be
finalised by the end of Friday (8th of April).  All code must be version
controlled using git and follow the rules specified in the General Git
Requirements and General Programming Requirements. Information from the
repository may be used in grading.  Personas and Scenarios (30%) Due: Thursday
14th April 2016, 04:00 am This is an individual assignment. You must write a
document that describes personas for this project. You will not be required to
use the personas or scenarios that you describe in this assignment in your
implemented system. However, the marking scheme for number and properties of
the personas will be used in marking the individual videos and presentations.

Core (65%):
2 personas
At least 1 scenario for each persona
At least 4 scenarios total
Completion (15%)
At least 3 personas
At least 2 scenarios per perona
At least 7 scenarios total
Challenge (20%):
At least 3 detailed personas. At least one of the personas and two of the scenar
  ios need to be different from a standard online marketplace such as Trade Me 
  or Etsy.
At least 2 secenarios per persona
At least 8 scenarios total
Must specify non-functional requirements

  

  
Individual Video Report (30%) Due: TBA June 2016, 04:00 am

For this assignment you will need to implement the website that you have
planned. This will be done in assigned groups of 4-5 students. You can
implement any of the personas from any member of your team, or create new ones.
There is a sample database if you want to use it called sampleDatabase.sql. To
load it run: psql example < sampleDatabase.sql where example is what you are
  calling the database.  You must do two things to hand in your assignment.
  Note that these must all be done individually.  Submit a video presentation
  of your tool explaining how and why you designed and implemented it.  Fill
  out a short survey about your assignment (this will be used in grading) Video
  requirements: Maximum length 5 minutes You should explicitly explain why your
  implementation is good Your video target audience is a technical expert from
  a potential investor.  If you cannot record a voice over you can either:
submit a transcript as a text file Embed text / subtitles into the video Submit
an external subtitle file (SRT, SSA, ASS) Survey questions: Who you are Who you
worked with Explain what you did and what your team members did Explain the
workings of one part of the system that you wrote You may also bring up any
issues that you had with your team members throughout the project. This can
include them not contributing their fair share, or being difficult (e.g. going
    into the project and changing all your code).


Group Presentation (15%) Due: Tuesday 24th May 2016, 04:00 am

This presentation will be done on the implementation that you have been working
on for the individual video assignments. This is a group assignment, and will
be done in the groups that you are programming in.  TBA minute presentation All
team members should speak Shows every scenario that you want marked You will
only be marked on scenarios which you show You are while demonstrating your
system, you must also be aiming to sell it. You must show what the system can
do (essentially your scenarios).  General Git Requirements The following rules
apply to all code written in this course and are mandatory: All source code
must be version controlled in a single main repository for each group Every
group member has write access to the repository Commits done in pairs must
feature the term "peer programming". Other commits must not (this is to make
    them easily searchable) Repository must be stored either in the shared
course space, or on a public Github Work must be committed to the repository on
the day that it is done.  General Programming Requirements The following rules
apply to all code written in this courses and are mandatory: All pages should
work in the ECS unix lab machine versions of Chrome and Firefox All pages
should scale appropriately when the window size is changed to mobile phone
sizes Software must be usable as well as correct You are only allowed to use
open source libraries Software can be written in any programming language - but
only queries relating to tools covered in lectures or required by the
assignment will be answered by staff and tutors. Where other languages are used
assistance may not be provided.
